	○ Achieve zero down-time, easy rollback
• Blue-green deployment
	○ Blue env: PROD
	○ Green env: new environment mimicking PROD
	○ Gradually divert more and more of  PROD traffic from blue to green (load balancing/canary analysis). 2 methods:
		1) DNS cutover
		2) Autoscaling
			• Replace existing servers with servers running new software version when autoscaling.
	○ Zero downtime, easy rollback
• Red-black deployment
	1) Canary testing: divert 1% of prod traffic to new red environment
	2) If all is OK, proceed.
	3) Set resources for red environment based on current usage in PROD
	4) DNS cutover from black (old PROD env) to new red env
	5) Rollback: return DNS to black (old PROV env)
	6) Use as Beta
• Immutable deployment
	○ Tear some servers down, spin up new ones, etc.
	○ Good for older app infrastructures with many patches over time

	○ Costlier
	○ Different testing teams
	○ Regression testing (code coverage)
• User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
	○ Replica of PROD
	○ System/performance testing
• A/B &amp; Canary testing
	○ Final testing conducted in PROD
	○ A/B &amp; Canary Testing
		§ Divert % to new PROD systems

	• AllAtOnce
	• Custom
5) Deploy code according to the chosen method
	1) Stop running application
	2) Download application binary
