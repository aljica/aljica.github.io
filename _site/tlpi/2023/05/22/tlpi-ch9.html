    <p>Process Credentials</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>• Processes have user ID/group ID credentials attached to them.
	○ You can have programs that, when run, have the privileges of the UID/GID attached to it.
	○ It can also be used to control who has access to the processes/programs, etc.
• Real User ID/Group ID
	○ For example, when a user logs in and /bin/bash is set to run in the /etc/passwd file, the /bin/bash process gets the user ID and group ID from the /etc/passwd as its real UID/GID.
• Effective User/Group ID
	○ Determines the privileges of a process when it comes to syscalls, file access etc.
		§ Files have associated users/groups, i.e. the owner of the file.
		§ Thus, the process's effective UID/GID may determine if it has access to that file.
	○ Effective is usually same as Real, but can be different in Set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.
• Set-User-ID programs
	○ Unprivileged users can set the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on files they own.
		§ Privileged users can do it on any files.
	○ Of interest are executable files.
		§ Setting the set-user-ID bit on an executable file to 1.
			□ When a process now executes that file (i.e. loads it into the process's memory), the effective UID (or GID) of the process is set to the same as the executable file being executed.
			□ This gives the process privileges it normally would not have.
	○ For instance; if an executable file is owned by root and the set-user-ID bit is set; a process executing that file does so with superuser/root privileges.
	○ It is possible to create a separate user account =&gt; assign it privileges to a system resource (file or other resource) =&gt; set the set-user-ID bit =&gt; now a process that executes it gets the effective user ID of that newly created account, and doesn't have to get root privileges. More secure!
	○ Set-User-ID programs include:
		§ Passwd
		§ Su
		§ Mount/umount
	○ Set-Group-ID program wall()
		§ Broadcasts a message to all terminals
		§ All terminals belong to the tty group by default
	○ For instance, the check_password program we wrote before, that takes some user input and checks the shadow password file, and uses crypt() to check if they are the same.
		§ You can set the owner of the check_password executable program using "chown" to be root.
		§ You can then set the set-user-ID bit to 1.
		§ Now when check_password is run, its effective User ID will be set to 0 (i.e. root) and it will have access to /etc/shadow passwords and will be able to use crypt() to compare user-supplied password.
• Saved User IDs
	○ Imagine a running process that has real_uid = effective_uid = saved_uid = 1000.
	○ Imagine this process executes a file that has the set_user_ID set to 0 (root). The process now has:
	○ Real_uid = 1000. effective_uid = saved_uid = 0.
	○ There are syscalls the process can then use to switch its effective UID between real and saved UID, only taking elevated privileges as it needs them.
• File system UID/GID determines a process's permissions to access files.
	○ Effective UID's take part in determining if a process can send/receive signals.
	○ If for example NFS (Network File System) changes its effective UID to access certain files the client process needs to access, then unprivileged users could potentially exploit this by sending signals to NFS.
	○ File-system UID's were devised to make this separation; now NFS can access files belonging to a client process without opening up the vulnerability of being sent signals by unprivileged processes.
	○ After Linux 2.0, the effective user ID no longer permits an unprivileged process to send signals to another. So, this is no longer an issue, really. The file-system ID feature is no longer necessary, either.
• Supplementary group IDs
	○ Set of additional groups to which a process belongs
	○ In conjunction with effective and file-system IDs, determines which System V interprocess communication (IPC) permissions it has, which files it can access, and other system resources.
• Retrieving and Modifying Process Credentials
	○ In /proc/PID/status, you can find the UIDs and GIDs associated with the process, in the order:
		§ Real ID, effective ID, saved ID, file-system ID
	○ Getuid(), geteuid(), getgid(), getegid()
		§ Get real and effective user/group ID's with these syscalls.
	○ Setuid/setgid
		§ Set the UID/GID of the process.
		§ If an unprivileged process calls this, it can only change to a value that is the same as its real, effective or saved UID. If executing a non-privileged program, this means the unprivileged process can't do anything meaningful with this syscall. It's only useful if executing a SUID binary.
		§ If a privileged process calls this, e.g. root (0) and sets its value to 3, then it permanently loses all its superuser privileges and cannot go back to root (0).
			□ This is only relevant for setuid(), not setgid().
	○ Seteuid/setegid
		§ Set effective user ID specifically.
		§ Privileged process could set its effective ID to something else then regain root privileges by using seteid to set it back to 0, i.e. the same as its real ID.
	○ Setreuid/setregid
		§ Set the real and effective user IDs. First parameter is real ID, second parameter is effective ID.
		§ An unprivileged process can only change the effective ID to the current Real or Saved ID.
		§ A privileged process can change the real and effective ID as it pleases.
		§ If an (un)privileged process changes the effective ID, the saved ID is also changed.
		§ If a privileged process changes the effective ID to the real ID, the saved ID remains unchanged. If the effective ID is set to any other ID than the real ID, the saved ID is also changed to the same ID as the new effective ID.
	○ Setresuid/setresgid
		§ 3 parameters: real, effective and saved ID.
		§ Unprivileged process can only change IDs that it already has as real, effective and saved.
		§ Privileged process can change as it likes.
		§ Specifying -1 for one of the parameters does not change it.
		§ All or nothing: either all changes are successful or none are.
		§ May not be portable; not specified in SUSv3, even though it's the most straight-forward.
		§ File-system ID is set to the effective ID.
	○ Setfsuid/setfsgid
		§ Set file-system ID
	○ Initgroups()
		§ Gets a user's groups from /etc/group
		§ Usually employed by programs that log a user in
			□ Supplementary group IDs retrieved from /etc/group
