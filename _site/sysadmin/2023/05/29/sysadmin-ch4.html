This way, in the code, you can have an if statement that checks if(fork() == 0) - then you know you are executing inside the child process. If fork() equals PID of the child, then you are executing in the parent process. The child can use an exec() command to run another command. Exec() also resets various memory segments so that the newly executing command becomes its own process entirely; the fork() command helps it setup the core things needed for a process - e.g. code, variables, stack, heap, etc. by simply copying them from the parent - but then it can change those and run as an entirely independent process." />
