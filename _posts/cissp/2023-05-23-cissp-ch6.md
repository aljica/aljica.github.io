* Cryptographic provides CIA for:
    * Data at rest.
    * Data in transit.
    * Data in use (in memory).
* Historical "arms race" of researchers developing stronger encryption algorithms, while hackers tried to break them.
    * We now have very sophisticated algorithms.

### Cryptographic Foundations

# Goals of Cryptography

* 4 fundamentals goals:
    * Confidentiality
    * Integrity
    * Authentication
    * Nonrepudiation
* Not all cryptosystems are designed to reach each goal.

#### Confidentiality

* Data remains private in rest, in transit, in use.
* "The preservation of secrecy".
* Symmetric cryptosystems
    * Shared key among users
* Asymmetric cryptosystems
    * Unique public/private keypair for each user
* Data at rest
    * On hard drives, backup tapes, USB, etc.
    * Data leak through physical theft of device
* Data in motion ("data on the wire")
    * Transmissions over network mediums
    * Data leak through eavesdropping attacks
* Data in use
    * Active in computer memory
    * Data leak through improper process isolation at operating system-layer

#### Integrity

* Ensures that data is not altered without authorization.
* Encrypted message digests.
    * Digital signatures (created using cryptography) to verify the contents of a message.
    * A recipient can then re-compute the signature for a message and compare it with the previous one to see if the message has been tampered with.
* Ensures data was not altered between time of creation and time of access.
* Allows for file integrity checking.

#### Authentication

* Verify a claimed identity.
* Challenge-Response authentication protocol:
    * Alice and Bob have a shared secret key and wish to communicate.
    * When they begin communicating online and claim who they are, Alice can ask Bob to encrypt a short message with the secret key they both know.
    * If Bob can return such an encrypted message, Alice can be certain it's him, because only they know that secret key.

#### Nonrepudiation

* Ensures who sent a message, and the fact that they did send that message.
* If only Bob knows the secret key, it must have been him who sent the message.
    * He can't later claim he didn't.
    * Unless the key was somehow leaked of course!
* This property is provided by ASYMMETRIC cryptosystems.

# Cryptography Concepts

* Plaintext (denoted "P")
    * Regular message before encryption
* Sender uses an algorithm used to _encrypt_ _plaintext_
    * This produces a _ciphertext_ (C)
* Recipient uses an algorithm (not necessarily different from the one sender used) to _decrypt_ the C into P.


* Cryptographic algorithms rely on _keys_
    * Key = usually just a number
* Each algorithm has its own _key space_
    * Key space = Valid range of values for a key
    * Defined by its _bit size_
        * Number of binary digits (1s and 0s) in the key
    * If bit size is 5, then key space is the range of numbers:
        * 00000 (in binary) = 0 (in decimal)
        * 11111 = 31 (i.e. 2<sup>5</sup>)
    * 128-bit key has key space from 0 to 2<sup>128</sup>
    * n-bit key has key space from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>
* Keep your keys SECRET!


* Kerchkoff's Principle
    * Algorithms used for encryption & decryption should be public
    * Cryptographic system should be secure even if everything except the secret key is known!
        * Security through obscurity is not better.
            * Public exposure => researchers can find weaknessess/faults quicker!

# Cryptographic Mathematics

* We will here discuss mathematics; logical operations that are the foundations of cryptography.
* You will not need to do math or solve cryptographical problems in a mathematical sense; but it's vital for your understanding!

#### Boolean Mathematics

* Decimal system - base 10 system
    * Each place value in a number is a multiple of 10
    * E.g. the number "21" can be calculated (going from right to left):
        * 1 * 10<sup>0</sup> + 2 * 10<sup>1</sup> = 1 * 1 + 2 * 10 = 1 + 20 = 21
    * In binary, "1011 is calculated as (going from right to left):
        * 1 * 2<sup>0</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>1</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 11

#### Logical operations

* Manipulating data:

#### AND operation

* Symbol ^
    * E.g. 1011 ^ 1111
    * The AND operation takes TWO inputs at a time.
    * So from 1011, we take the 1 from the left, and from 1111, we take the 1 from the left, and we input them to the AND function
        * The AND operation returns 1 if both input bits are 1, and returns 0 otherwise:
        * Since both are 1's, the first output/return value in the resulting number is also 1
    * See the examples below.

#### OR

* The symbol for OR is V.
* If X and Y are both 0, the output is 0.
    * Else, the output is 1.
* Can you figure out the output of X: 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 OR Y: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1?
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

    X V Y: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1

</details>


#### NOT

* Symbol for NOT is ~
* Invert a bit
* If X is 1, ~X would be 0, and vice versa.

#### Exclusive OR (XOR)

* Symbol is &oplus;
* If X and Y are both 0's or 1's, the output is 0.
    * Else, if X and Y are both different (e.g. X is 0 and Y is 1, or X is 1 and Y is 0), the output is 1.
* Can you solve 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 &oplus; 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

    X &oplus; Y: 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1

</details>

#### Modulo function

* Symbol can be either the word "mod" or the percentage %
* Modulo returns the remainder of a division operation
    * Let's say you divide 6 by 4, i.e. 6 / 4
    * The result is 1 (because 4 fits only once into 6) with a remainder value of 2
    * The module function outputs that remainder value 2
        * So: 6 mod 4 = 6 % 4 = 2

* Can you figure out what 33 mod 10 is?
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

    33 mod 10 = 33 % 10 = 3
