* Cryptographic provides CIA for:
    * Data at rest.
    * Data in transit.
    * Data in use (in memory).
* Historical "arms race" of researchers developing stronger encryption algorithms, while hackers tried to break them.
    * We now have very sophisticated algorithms.

### Cryptographic Foundations

# Goals of Cryptography

* 4 fundamentals goals:
    * Confidentiality
    * Integrity
    * Authentication
    * Nonrepudiation
* Not all cryptosystems are designed to reach each goal.

#### Confidentiality

* Data remains private in rest, in transit, in use.
* "The preservation of secrecy".
* Symmetric cryptosystems
    * Shared key among users
* Asymmetric cryptosystems
    * Unique public/private keypair for each user
* Data at rest
    * On hard drives, backup tapes, USB, etc.
    * Data leak through physical theft of device
* Data in motion ("data on the wire")
    * Transmissions over network mediums
    * Data leak through eavesdropping attacks
* Data in use
    * Active in computer memory
    * Data leak through improper process isolation at operating system-layer

#### Integrity

* Ensures that data is not altered without authorization.
* Encrypted message digests.
    * Digital signatures (created using cryptography) to verify the contents of a message.
    * A recipient can then re-compute the signature for a message and compare it with the previous one to see if the message has been tampered with.
* Ensures data was not altered between time of creation and time of access.
* Allows for file integrity checking.

#### Authentication

* Verify a claimed identity.
* Challenge-Response authentication protocol:
    * Alice and Bob have a shared secret key and wish to communicate.
    * When they begin communicating online and claim who they are, Alice can ask Bob to encrypt a short message with the secret key they both know.
    * If Bob can return such an encrypted message, Alice can be certain it's him, because only they know that secret key.

#### Nonrepudiation

* Ensures who sent a message, and the fact that they did send that message.
* If only Bob knows the secret key, it must have been him who sent the message.
    * He can't later claim he didn't.
    * Unless the key was somehow leaked of course!
* This property is provided by ASYMMETRIC cryptosystems.

# Cryptography Concepts

* Plaintext (denoted "P")
    * Regular message before encryption
* Sender uses an algorithm used to _encrypt_ _plaintext_
    * This produces a _ciphertext_ (C)
* Recipient uses an algorithm (not necessarily different from the one sender used) to _decrypt_ the C into P.


* Cryptographic algorithms rely on _keys_
    * Key = usually just a number
* Each algorithm has its own _key space_
    * Key space = Valid range of values for a key
    * Defined by its _bit size_
        * Number of binary digits (1s and 0s) in the key
    * If bit size is 5, then key space is the range of numbers:
        * 00000 (in binary) = 0 (in decimal)
        * 11111 = 31 (i.e. 2<sup>5</sup>)
    * 128-bit key has key space from 0 to 2<sup>128</sup>
    * n-bit key has key space from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>
* Keep your keys SECRET!


* Kerchkoff's Principle
    * Algorithms used for encryption & decryption should be public
    * Cryptographic system should be secure even if everything except the secret key is known!
        * Security through obscurity is not better.
            * Public exposure => researchers can find weaknessess/faults quicker!
