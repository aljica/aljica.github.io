	• /proc filesystem
		○ How many files are currently locked?
			§ Which processes are holding those locks?
		○ How many files is a process holding?
		○ Basically, getting information about processes.
		○ What sockets are being used?
	• Traditionally, older UNIX implementations allowed privileged programs to access kernel data structures/memory directly to find information related to processes. This caused some problems.
		○ Now, the kernel provides a virtual file system under /proc.
			§ A virtual file system does not reside on disk; it is created on-the-fly when a program needs access to /proc to get/(set) process information.
		○ Programs can in a more convenient way access processes information via /proc and make changes to some aspects using system calls and regular file I/O.
	• /proc/PID
		○ Contains process information
		○ /proc/PID/status
			§ This file contains the status of the process
			§ Because /proc/PID/status tends to change over time, don't parse the file by line number
				□ PARSE BY THE STRING, e.g. PPID: <number> which may change from being on line 7 to line 17 as new things are added to the file.
		○ Other files: cwd (current working dir), exe (symlink to file being executed), environ (env list), cmdline (cmdline arguments), mounts (mount points for the process), etc…
	• /proc/PID/fd directory
		○ E.g. /proc/PID/fd/1 is a symlink to stdout (standard output) for that process
	• A process can access its own /proc/PID dir through /proc/self
	• Threads: /proc/PID/task/<thread-id>
		○ Because threads share memory, similar information is stored across threads under the corresponding thread-id directory.
		○ Information that might differ in for e.g. the status file are things like the current state of the thread, signals-related information and some other things.
	• Various sub-directories for various settings
		○ /proc/net - networking/sockets settings
		○ /proc/sys/net - networking/sockets again
		○ Proc/kernel - kernel settings
		○ Etc
	• Who/when can we modify /proc files?
		○ /proc/PID files can be modified by root or, for some of the files (e.g. environ), only the file owner (i.e. the user who created the process)
		○ Some files are read-only, meaning they cannot be modified, e.g. those that simply display kernel info
		○ Most files under /proc are owned by root, meaning only root can modify them.
	• Uname(&uts)
		○ Uts is a struct with a bunch of fields such as version, machine, system name, release etc…
		○ Basically uname returns a bunch of information about the host system.
