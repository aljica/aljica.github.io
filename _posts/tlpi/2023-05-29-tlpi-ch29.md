### 29 Threads: Introduction

* How POSIX Threads (PThreads) work
* When to use multithreaded vs multiprocess applications?

### 29.1 Overview

* A regular process is a single-threaded process.
* Threads share the same memory; (un)initialized data, heap, code, but have different stacks.
* On multi-core systems, threads can execute concurrently (e.g. while one waits for I/O).

* Achieving concurrency in concurrent applications, e.g. network servers:
    * Possible to use fork() i.e. multiprocess, or multithreaded.
    * Disadvantages of multiprocess [using fork()]:
        1. Expensive (copying page tables, file attributes, and much more).
        2. Cannot easily exchange information between parent and child processes.
    * Threads address these problems:
        1. Faster than copying with fork().
        2. All threads share the same data.

* Threads share a number of attributes:
    * PID and parent PID.
    * Process GID and Session ID.
    * Controlling terminal.
    * Process credentials (UID/GID).
    * Open file descriptors.
    * Record locks.
    * Signal dispositions.
    * Current working dir, root dir, etc.
    * Interval timers.
    * System V semaphore.
    * Resource limits.
    * CPU time consumed.
    * Resources consumed.
    * Nice value (setpriority(), scheduling).

* Threads have different values for:
    * Thread ID.
    * Signal mask.
    * Thread-specific data.
    * Alternate signal stack.
    * Errno variable.
    * Floating-point environment.
    * Realtime scheduling policy/priority.
    * CPU affinity.
    * Capabilities.
    * Stack.



* Threads CAN share stacks, but be very careful.
    * If one thread returns and another thread has a pointer to something on that threads stack, that stack frame may get popped.
        * This can lead to very obscure bugs.


### 29.2 Background details of the Pthreads API

# Pthreads data types

![Image](/docs/assets/images/tlpi/ch29/threads-data-types.jpeg)

# Threads and errno

* Global errno does not work with multithreaded applications; otherwise, how would a given thread know when an error code is meant for itself?
* Thus, multithreaded programs have their own errcode for each thread.

# Return value from Pthreads functions

* 0 on success, positive value on failure.
    * Usually on Linux it's 0 on success, negative value on failure.
* Each errno reference means a function call.
    * Thus, store the result of a pthread_create() call in another local variable to avoid this overhead.

```C
int s;
s = pthread_create(&thread, NULL, func, &arg);
if (s != 0)
    errExit("pthread_create failed");
```

# Compiling pthreads programs

* Use the `cc - pthread` option when compiling.
    * Preprocessor defines the _REENTRANT macro.
        * Re-entrant function definition:
            * A program can be interrupted in the middle of its execution, and then resumed.

### 29.3 Thread Creation

```C
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start)(void *), void *arg);
```

* The existing thread calls pthread_create, which creates a new thread and calls the function "start" with the "arg" as argument (start(arg)).
    * The existing thread then continues execution from the next line of code.

* We can pass a pointer as arg.
    * Pass pointer to a struct if you require multiple arguments.
    * It can also be NULL.

* Return value of start is void - its usage will be further explained.

* Thread points to a buffer of type pthread_t.

* After a call to pthread_create, threads may run simultaneously.
* Scheduling policies may mean that threads execute concurrently on different cores.

### 29.6 Joining with a terminated thread

* pthread_join() waits for thread to terminate.
    * If that thread already terminated, pthread_join() returns immediately.

`int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);`

### Simple thread

```C
#include <pthread.h>
#include "tlpi_hdr.h"

static void *
threadFunc(void *arg)
{
    char *s = (char *) arg;

    printf("%s", s);

    return (void *) strlen(s);
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    pthread_t t1;
    void *res;
    int s;

    s = pthread_create(&t1, NULL, threadFunc, "Hello world\n");
    if (s != 0)
        errExitEN(s, "pthread_create");

    printf("Message from main()\n");
    s = pthread_join(t1, &res);
    if (s != 0)
        errExitEN(s, "pthread_join");

    printf("Thread returned %ld\n", (long) res);

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```
