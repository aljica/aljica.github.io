	• Clos Network Fabric
		○ Hundreds of switches combined as in the image
		○ This way you get thousands of ports and you can, through virtual switching, have many thousands of ports

# System software that organizes the hardware

	• Managing Machines (BNS)
		○ Google uses Borg, similar to Apache Mesos.
		○ Borg gets a job request => runs it on a machine.
		○ Borg maps tasks from paths to IP address:port.
			§ /borg/cluster/user/job-name/task-number to IP:port.
		○ A job must advertise to Borg management server how much resources it needs (CPU, RAM, etc).
		○ If a job uses too much resources, it is killed and restarted.
		○ A job consists of multiple tasks. Tasks are run on different clusters to avoid having the top-of-rack switch of one cluster be a single point of failure.
	• Storage
		○ Each machine in the cluster can use its own local hard disk storage.
			§ Each machine runs its own file server.
			§ All local storage is eventually sent to D (see below).
		○ D runs a cluster-wide filesystem that all machines can access.
			§ D has both blob storage, noSQL, and SQL interfaces.
	• Networking
		○ Google uses cheaper switching hardware, but has a centralized component that calculates optimal network paths instead of buying more expensive "smart" hardware that does this.
		○ The centralized component also manages bandwidth availability to maximize the average available bandwidth. This is otherwise a very complex problem to solve, traditionally.
		○ Global load balancing with DNS load balancing (e.g. google.com), user service level load balancing (e.g. Google Maps, YouTube etc) and RPC load balancing.
		○ Services can run their jobs in geographically distributed clusters.

# Other System Software

	• Lock Service
		○ Chubby handles locks across datacenter locations.
		○ Chubby also handles master selection - e.g. if a service has 5 replica jobs running (for reliability purposes), Chubby determines which one gets to run.
		○ Chubby is great for BNS to use to maintain consistent path to socket (IP address:port) pairings.
	• Monitoring and Alerting
		○ Agents that collect data.
		○ Can measure performance after a server update, or simply over time, and present it as a graph.

# Our Software Infrastructure

	• Heavily multithreaded code.
	• Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) even when a call to a subroutine in a local program needs to be made.
		○ Allows for modularity and scalability in case that routine would be in a remote program.
	• Each server has an HTTP server for diagnostics/logging.

# Our Development Environment

	• Shared repository
	• Push code; code gets sent to build servers in the data center.
	• Build servers can compile the code in parallel, so it's very fast.
	• Testing occurs based on the changelist/pieces of code that may have been affected.
