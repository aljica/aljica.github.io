title: Using ChatGPT to Study for Certifications
categories: chatgpt

Here is a very simple but extremely powerful tool to study for certifications or just remembering valuable pieces of information.

Imagine you're reading a section in a book chapter, a piece of online documentation, or anything else. Your normal process might be to take meticulous notes in your favourite text editor, summarizing it, maybe creating flash cards, your own practice questions, and so on.

Instead of doing that, try this:

Read your documentation, and only do that. Focus exclusively on understanding the information. Forget your notepad, forget everything else. It's just your mind and the piece of information in front of you.

Once you've read the information once, or even twice, copy the section(s) you're interested in and paste them into ChatGPT. Use the following prompt:

"Ask me as many questions as possible and allow me to answer them one by one, based on the following information: *paste here*"

You can even prompt it to ask you the questions with multiple-choices:

"Ask me as many multiple-choice questions as possible and allow me to answer them one by one, based on the following information: *paste here*"

The trick here is that you are pasting the information you want ChatGPT to quiz you on, as opposed to asking it to use its own knowledge. That way, you are guaranteed to get the correct information, and you are using ChatGPT as a practice exam / flash card generator. 

Note that when you copy the information you're reading, don't worry if you're on a website where there's a bunch of videos and images and so on. Just copy the text you need and dump it in ChatGPT without worrying too much about formatting - ChatGPT is a powerful tool, so it understands. If you need information from just an image, there's ways you can extract the text using OCR. If you are watching a Udemy video, click on "Transcripts" and everything the content creator said will appear in the right panel. Copy that and paste it into ChatGPT along with the prompt, and it will quiz you based on that.

To me, this is revolutionizing, because it allows me to fully immerse myself in watching the video or reading the paragraph, without worrying about switching tabs to take notes or subsequently creating flash cards and practice questions and reviewing my notes and so on - which is also very time consuming.

Instead, I can focus on one thing at a time, and afterwards, I have an extremely knowledgable teacher by my side who can both explain difficult concepts but also who will quiz me, which helps me with active recall for long-term retention. While ChatGPT asks me questions, I am actively practicing the Feynman Technique by both verbally explaining the answer to myself, and then I also have to formulate it properly in written form as a response to ChatGPT.

I hope this helps.
