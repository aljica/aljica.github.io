My name is aljica and I currently work as a Security Consultant/Architect. I recently passed my CISSP exam (and was awarded the Associate of ISC2 certification) and I am a Microsoft Certified Cybersecurity Architect Expert. In addition, having a background as a software engineer, I am closely familiar with the secure software development lifecycle (secure SDLC).

You can navigate at the top to see summaries of books I have read and practical proof-of-concept implementations I have done, which I primarily do to satisfy my curiosity for learning and understanding how things work, and to stay updated in the ever-changing tech world.
